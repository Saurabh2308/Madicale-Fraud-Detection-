# Medicare Provider Fraud Detection
 

Overview
This project focuses on developing a robust machine learning-based system for detecting Medicare provider fraud. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset containing Medicare beneficiary and claim information, the goal is to build a fraud detection model capable of identifying suspicious activities among healthcare providers.

Key Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted in-depth exploration of beneficiary and claim data to uncover patterns and insights crucial for fraud detection.

Feature Engineering: Engineered two feature sets (SET-1 and SET-2) including basic EDA features, aggregated features, and code embeddings similarity features to capture nuanced information from the data.

Model Training and Evaluation: Trained machine learning models on both feature sets and evaluated their performance using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC score.

Results
Achieved an impressive accuracy of 85% with the deployed model, demonstrating its efficacy in detecting potential Medicare provider fraud.

The project offers stakeholders valuable insights into Medicare fraud detection, contributing to improved healthcare fraud prevention efforts.

Further Insights
Business Documentation: Detailed insights into the potential business impact of the fraud detection system, including cost savings, risk mitigation, and healthcare quality improvement.

Technical Documentation: Comprehensive technical documentation covering the model development process, feature interpretation, and future directions for improvement.
