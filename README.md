# Medicare Provider Fraud Detection
 

### Overview
This project focuses on developing a robust machine learning-based system for detecting Medicare provider fraud. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset containing Medicare beneficiary and claim information, the goal is to build a fraud detection model capable of identifying suspicious activities among healthcare providers.

### Key Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted in-depth exploration of beneficiary and claim data to uncover patterns and insights crucial for fraud detection.

Feature Engineering: Engineered two feature sets (SET-1 and SET-2) including basic EDA features, aggregated features, and code embeddings similarity features to capture nuanced information from the data.

Model Training and Evaluation: Trained machine learning models on both feature sets and evaluated their performance using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC score.

### Technical Details
Machine Learning Algorithms: Utilized various machine learning algorithms including decision trees, logistic regression, and ensemble methods for training the fraud detection model.

Feature Engineering Techniques: Implemented feature engineering techniques such as one-hot encoding, aggregation, and code embeddings to extract meaningful information from categorical and numerical features.

Model Evaluation: Employed cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning techniques to optimize model performance and generalization.

### Results
Achieved an impressive accuracy of 85% with the deployed model, demonstrating its efficacy in detecting potential Medicare provider fraud.

The project offers stakeholders valuable insights into Medicare fraud detection, contributing to improved healthcare fraud prevention efforts.
